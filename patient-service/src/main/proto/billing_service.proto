// gRPC = Google Remote Procedure Call.
// “gRPC is a framework that lets programs communicate with each other over the network as if they were calling local functions.
// You define services and messages in a .proto file using Protocol Buffers, and it generates client and server code automatically.
// It’s fast, strongly typed, supports streaming, and works across multiple programming languages
